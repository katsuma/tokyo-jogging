  Tokyo-Jogging

  Tokyo-Jogging is a mashup project using wiimote and google street view.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


= What you need to build

== Wiimote
You've already had this one, haven't you? And you can also use your nunchuk
and blance wii board.

== Bluetooth stack
You need a Blue stack to run Tokyo-Jogging.

On Mac OSX, You'll have no problems. You can use a default Bluetooth stack.

But on Windows, you MUST obtain a separate Bluetooth stack. Theoretically, BlueSoleil(*) should work, but it will be better with WIDOMM for most people.

I developed and built Tokyo-Jogging on Mac OSX, so I don't know much about how to build on Windows. If you succeeded to build it, let me know it, please.

== JDK
You need JDK 1.5 or higher version to build and run Tokyo-Jogging.

On Mac OSX, you can use default JDK. On Windows, you need to install and add the Java executable to your Command Prompt path.

== Eclipse
You can run Tokyo-Jogging without using Eclipse. But it's very useful for building and running itand I recommend it. Eclipse is a very handy (and free!) IDE that has a special place in the hearts of many Java programmers.

And I wrote how to run Tokyo-Jogging without using Eclise below.


= How to build

1. You can download source code files or archived file from github. Type this command and you'll get source code files.
   git clone git@github.com:katsuma/tokyo-jogging.git

   Or You can download archived file from here.
   http://github.com/katsuma/tokyo-jogging/downloads

2. Open Eclipse and select "New > Java Project" from the File menu. "Project name" is a free name, for example,"MyTokyoJogging".

3. Click "Finish" button.

4. Copy the src and lib directory in unzipped directory and paste to your project(it may named "MyTokyoJogging") at Package Explorer.

5. Right-click on your package root directory and select "Propertied".

6. Select "Java Build Path".

7. Click the Libraries tab. Add in all JAR files in "lib" directory by clicking on Add External JARs. And after that Eclipse will re-build your project automatically.


= How to run (without Eclipse)
1. Open Terminal and change the unzipped location.
   (ex: cd /Users/YOUR_NAME/Desktop/Tokyo-Jogging/)

2. Enter this command.
   ./start-jogging.sh

3. Press the "SYNC" button on your back of Wiimote. If Tokyo-Jogging finds your Wiimote, the message will be displayed on Eclipse console.

4. Open your web browser and go to http://www.tokyo-jogging.com/start/.

5. Put your Wiimote to your pocket and clean up around you.

6. Have fun! :-)

= How to run (with Eclipse)

1. On Eclipse, right-click on your package root directory and select "Run As > Java Application".

2. Select "TokyoJogging - tv.katsuma.jog" and click "OK" button. And it will run the program.

3. Press the "SYNC" button on your back of Wiimote. If Tokyo-Jogging finds your Wiimote, the message will be displayed on Eclipse console.

4. Open your web browser and go to http://www.tokyo-jogging.com/start/.

5. Put your Wiimote to your pocket and clean up around you.

6. Have fun! :-)

= FAQ
== for Snow Leopard user
If you use Snow Leopard, check your Java version. You need use JRE 32bit version. If you use Eclipse, set VM arguments -d32. It launches your JRE 32-bit version.

== Got an exception, java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: PCM values restricted by JAR82 to minimum 4097
When you run the program and if you got an exception "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: PCM values restricted by JAR82 to minimum 4097", you need to set the JVM option. If you use Eclipse, set VM arguments -Dbluecove.jsr82.psm_minimum_off=true.
